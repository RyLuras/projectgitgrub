            Zack was born in Seattle Washington in the late 20th century. He has developed an interest in language, aviation, cars, philosophy, travel, and of course, hiking. He has enjoyed time in many countries, he has learned German, how to fly an airplane, and how to drive a car calmly in traffic. Zack is currently building an app for a cooking game.
