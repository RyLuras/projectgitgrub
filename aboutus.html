                    Ryan Luras Ryan was born in the San Francisco Bay Area has been living in Portland for the last decade (keep your transplant comments to yourself). He occupies his time by coding, writing and drawing. He spends too much time reading and dreaming about making video games yet rarely plays them. An armchair historian and carpenter, he's always down for a good heated debate or demolition day.
